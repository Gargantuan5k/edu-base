 HOW DO I USE eduBase?
x---------------------x

1. STUDENTS LIST
First, create a students list, following the menu instructions. This is a list of all the students in your classroom and their roll numbers.
(Use the main menu option titled 'Manage my Students List')
You can edit or delete the list at any time, but you can have only one list active at a time.
All other features provided by eduBase use the names and roll numbers in this Students List.
You can also export your class list to a .csv file for your convenience!


2. ATTENDANCE
Follow menu instructions to manage attendance data for your class. This is under the main menu option labelled 'Manage my class' Attendance data'.
Enter the date to manage attendance for, or leave it blank to use today's date automatically.
Further menu instructions will allow you to take roll call, mark attendancec for individual students
and also export an attendance report to CSV!


3. MARKS
The 'Manage my class' Marks data' option allows you to modify the marks of all your students, or an individual student.
You can also wipe your marks data and start over.
Additionally, you can export the Marks list as a CSV file for easy access!


You can view the source code for this project at https://github.com/Gargantuan5k/edu-base. Installation instructions are also available.

Hope you find this helpful, and thanks for choosing eduBase! :)
